## :mortar_board: This is a university project on the subject of Object-Oriented Programming.

### :skier: You play as a ski runner. 

:dash: The main game mechanic is inertial movement - your character stops only when they meet an object on their way (but don't meet traps, they're dangerous!)

:trophy: The main goal is to collect all prizes on a level. Collecting prizes increases your score count, so you can set your own records!
